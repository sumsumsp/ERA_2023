# Part 1
### Goal
To do simple neural network training with forward and backward propagation in different learning rates (in excel)

It is a simple neural network with one hidden layer with 2 neurons (h1, h2). The data has come from input neuron layer (i1, i2). It follows same rule as explained above. The features of Neural network are given Figure 1. The detail step is given in Excel sheet attached.
